## Usage

The imporant use of the this is to have a study guide to turn to when things get tough or if you have any questions about the diffrent languages used. Once on the webpage itself, I'd advise opeing the chrome dev screen my hitting cmd,option, an I for Mac and Shift, Cmd, I for windows. There it will list the langues and give you a direction to start learning in .
