# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- When working on this project, I was very motivatied to learn how to create a website. I've self taught myself Javascript but I was very intrested in how to add it with HTMl and CSS to create a webpage. 
- I built this project in order to have an enviromnet to take notes down for my class and have an active project to work on and add to during my time in the DU full stack program. Ideally, to create a pleasing design for to syudy from. This is a huge project for me as it's a safe place to experiment with new ideas and code. 
- It solves the problem of both leaerning and studying. It has a hands on approach that allows me to immediatly take the code that I am learning and apply it to an active project. Thus creating a deeper learning of my time in the code course.
- During this project, I have learned the basics of HTML and CSS. How to write both in their respected languages. I was able to take the little bit of javascript I have taught myself and apply it to web design. Gaining a deeper understanding how how a front end developer really works. I plan on taking my time before my class starts to dive deeper in what I have learned and gained from this project.

## Usage

The imporant use of the this is to have a study guide to turn to when things get tough or if you have any questions about the diffrent languages used. For instance, if I am coding alone or can't quiet remember specific rules for each code I have a all and one place to check. Once on the webpage itself, I'd advise opening the chrome dev screen by hitting cmd, option, an I for Mac and Shift, Cmd, I for windows. There it will list the langues and give you a random direction to start learning in. If you don't want to study the suggested language just refresh the page!
